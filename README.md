# Node.js Backend Server with Express.js

This project is a backend server built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, utilizing **EJS** as a template engine and **SQLite** as the database. The frontend is styled with **HTML, CSS, and Simple.css**.

## Features

- **Express.js** – Lightweight and fast web framework
- **EJS** – Templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering
- **SQLite** – Embedded SQL database for easy storage
- **Simple.css** – Minimal styling framework for clean UI
- **NPM** – Dependency management for JavaScript
- **Nodemon** – Auto-restarts the server during development

---
